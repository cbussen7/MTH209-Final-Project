# MTH209-Final-Project

For this project, I found several NBA datasets throughout the Internet and decided to create an NBA statistical analysis, looking at things like the correlation between advanced stats, how height, weight, and position affect basic statistical categories, and much more. For a more in depth description and overview of this project, please download the intro video where I quickly go through the project.
